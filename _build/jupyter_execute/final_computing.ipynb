    "5. Otherwise, if the word on the page alphabetically is before the word we are looking for, discard the first half of the book.\n",
    "6. Otherwise, if the word on the page is alphabetically after the word we are looking for, discard the second half of the book.\n",
    "7. Otherwise, If the dictionary is empty, then exit, as the word is not in the dictionary.\n",
