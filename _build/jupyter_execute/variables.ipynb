    "\n",
    "Data is the foundation of modern computing, referring to the information or values that can be processed or manipulated by a program. In computing, data is represented in various forms such as numbers, text, images, sounds, and more complex structures like lists, dictionaries, and user-defined objects. These data types are essential as they dictate the kind of operations that programs can perform on the data, influencing both the functionality and performance of software applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How is Data Stored in Computers?\n",
    "\n",
    "Data in computers is primarily stored in binary form, using combinations of zeros and ones. Each bit represents a power of two, and when combined, they can represent any numerical value. For instance, data such as integers, floating points, and strings are stored using specific encoding systems like ASCII or Unicode for text, and IEEE standards for floating-point numbers. These data types are then stored in memory locations that are accessible by the computer's processor, allowing for fast retrieval and manipulation. Modern computers also use various storage devices like RAM, hard drives, and SSDs, which help in managing data efficiently for different needsâ€”speed, permanence, or capacity.\n",
